#### Description
Description
The Hangman Game project is a simple text-based game where the player attempts to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of chances. It's a classic game that challenges the player's word recognition skills and provides an enjoyable and interactive experience.

#### Aim
The primary goal of the Hangman Game project is to develop a simple yet engaging game that demonstrates the progression of a project through multiple milestones. It aims to showcase the incremental development of features, from basic functionality to an enhanced user experience.

#### What I Learned
Throughout the development of this Hangman Game, I gained valuable experience in:
Basic Python programming concepts.
User input validation and handling.
Randomization and list manipulation in Python.
Simple ASCII art for visual representation.
Project structuring and incremental development.

#### Milestone 1: Basic Structure
Implement a basic version of the game with a hard-coded word.
Allow the player to input letters and display the progress of the word.
#### Milestone 2: Randomized Words
Introduce a list of words and randomly select one for each game.
Add logic to check the validity of user input and update the game accordingly.
#### Milestone 3: Visual Representation
Enhance the user interface by adding ASCII art for the hangman.
Improve the display of guessed letters and the hidden word.
#### Milestone 4: User Feedback and End Game
Provide feedback on the player's performance after each round.
Implement a mechanism to end the game, revealing the word if not guessed.
